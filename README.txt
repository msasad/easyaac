README

EasyAac is a small shell script which can be used to batch convert MP3 files to AAC+. This
script requires lame, aacplusenc and MP4Box, they can be installed on Ubuntu by issuing the
following command

sudo apt-get install lame aacplusenc gpac

Usage:
./easyaac.sh playlist.m3u bitrate

To convert files, simply create a playlist of songs you want to convert, using your favorite
music player and save/export it in .m3u format. 

(The script has been tested to work with m3u playlists generated with Rhythmbox, Totem and
Audacious, however playlists generated by other players should work as well) 

Put the generated playlist in the same directory as the script and execute

./easyaac.sh playlist.m3u bitrate

Where bitrate is the desired bitrate of the output files in kbps.

(If the above command gives an error "permission denied" please execute the command chmod +x
easyaac.sh and run the script again.)
The converted files will be placed in a subdirectory with the same name as the playlist.

NOTE: ID3 Tag information is currently lost during conversion.  --fixed as of V 0.2 

Enjoy!!!
